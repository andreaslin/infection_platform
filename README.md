# Infection platform

## Design overview
- Each user store the other users that he/she is coaching, as well as the user that coaches him/her.
- Users are then divided into clusters. Each clusters are generated by looking at both the coaching and coached by relationships.
- **Total infection** will infect all users in the same cluster
- **Limited infection** will check the size of the cluster before infection

## How to run
**NOTE**: For demonstrating purpose, please run with simple tag. The complete test will take up to 10 minutes to finish, so please **DO NOT RUN complete tag** unless you are crazy like me.
```
> python infection_test.py [-h] [-type {complete,simple}]
```

## More details
- The user information is stored in json files
- A simple graphical representation of users can be found in the data directory in png format
  * Each cluster is a directed graph
  * Each edge represents the coaching relation
  * There's a png of 10,000 users, 20MB. Please ask me for the file if you really want it :grimacing:

## Assumptions
- No self coaching
- No update of user is performed

## TODO
- Update the users/clusters
- Create a visualization of the relations between users and the infectionâ€™s spread
